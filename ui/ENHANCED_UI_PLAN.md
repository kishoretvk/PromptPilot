# Enhanced UI Plan for PromptPilot

## Core UI Sections

### 1. Prompt Management
- Input new prompt (rich editor, markdown/code support)
- Select LLM provider (dropdown: OpenAI, Ollama, Gemini, etc.)
- Fine-tune/optimize prompt (interactive suggestions, AI-powered improvements)
- Finalize and version prompt (assign version, add notes)
- Save prompt and view all prompt versions/iterations (history, diff, revert)
- Test prompt with sample variables and see LLM output inline

### 2. Prompt Iteration & Testing
- List of all prompt versions and their test results
- Compare prompt iterations (side-by-side diff, metrics)
- Run test cases and view evaluation metrics

### 3. Pipeline Builder
- Visual node-based pipeline editor (drag-and-drop steps, branching, chaining)
- Configure step logic, error handling, and branching conditions

### 4. Analytics & Dashboard
- Usage stats, evaluation metrics, and performance charts
- Success/failure rates, cost tracking, LLM usage breakdown

### 5. Settings
- Theme switcher (dark/light mode)
- System settings (API keys, LLM provider configs, rate limits)
- User preferences (default provider, language, etc.)

### 6. Integrations
- Agent framework connectors (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.)
- Webhooks, API tokens, and external integrations

## Modern UI/UX Features

- Responsive design (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Dark and light themes (user/system toggle)
- Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility
- Real-time feedback and notifications (toasts, banners)
- Modular, component-based architecture (React recommended)
- State management (Redux, Zustand, or Context API)
- API integration layer for backend communication

---

## Integration Plan

- Use REST API and/or WebSockets for backend communication.
- Modularize API calls for prompt CRUD, pipeline execution, analytics, etc.
- Use a UI framework (MUI, Chakra, Ant Design, or Tailwind for styling).
- Scaffold with Create React App or Vite for fast development.
- Plan for future plugin/extension support.

---

## Next Steps

1. Scaffold the React app in `ui/dashboard`.
2. Implement navigation and layout (sidebar, topbar, theme switcher).
3. Build Prompt Management UI (input, provider select, versioning, test).
4. Add prompt history/iteration view and test runner.
5. Scaffold pipeline builder and analytics dashboard.
6. Integrate with backend API for prompt and pipeline operations.
7. Add settings and system configuration pages.
8. Polish with modern UI/UX, accessibility, and theming.
