# PromptPilot Web UI (Dashboard)

This directory will contain the source code for the PromptPilot web dashboard.

## Planned Features

- Prompt management interface (CRUD, versioning, search)
- Analytics and evaluation dashboards
- LLM pipeline builder and visualization
- Integration with API and storage backends

## Tech Stack (suggested)

- Frontend: React or Vue.js
- API: Connects to FastAPI backend

## Getting Started

1. Scaffold the frontend app (e.g., with Create React App or Vite).
2. Implement core components for prompt listing, editing, and analytics.
3. Connect to the backend API for data and actions.

This is a placeholder for future UI development.
