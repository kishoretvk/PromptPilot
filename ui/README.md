# PromptPilot Web UI

This directory will contain the source code for the PromptPilot web dashboard.

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js and npm if not already installed.
2. Scaffold the frontend app (e.g., with Create React App or Vite):

   ```sh
   cd ui
   npx create-react-app dashboard
   cd dashboard
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. Connect the frontend to the PromptPilot API (see `api/rest.py`).

## Planned Features

- Prompt management interface (CRUD, versioning, search)
- Analytics and evaluation dashboards
- LLM pipeline builder and visualization
- Integration with API and storage backends

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (recommended), or Vue.js
- API: Connects to FastAPI backend
